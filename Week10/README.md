# DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I DID FOR WEEK 10


# S3 TO LAMBDA INTEGRATION

This project demonstrates how to set up an **AWS Lambda function** that automatically triggers when a new file is uploaded to an **Amazon S3 bucket**. The Lambda reads the event data and logs the bucket name and file name to **CloudWatch Logs**.


## WHAT I DID
- I created an S3 bucket named `chidera-week10-csn-task`.
- I created a Lambda function with Python 3.11 runtime.
- I added an **S3 trigger** for `ObjectCreated (All)` events.
- I used the following Lambda handler code to log upload details:

    ```python
    import json

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event))
        try:
            records = event.get("Records", [])
            for r in records:
                bucket = r["s3"]["bucket"]["name"]
                key = r["s3"]["object"]["key"]
                print(f"New object uploaded: s3://{bucket}/{key}")
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error parsing event:", str(e))
        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": json.dumps("OK")
        }
    ```
- I Uploaded a test file `test.txt` via S3 console to trigger Lambda.
- I Verified the execution in **CloudWatch Logs** â€” confirmed bucket and file name logged.

  ## DELIVERABLES
- **S3 Bucket**: `chidera-week10-csn-task`
- **Lambda Function**: `s3-upload-logger-week10` (Python 3.11 runtime)
- **S3 Event Trigger**: Configured for `ObjectCreated (All)` events.
- **CloudWatch Logging**: Captures and displays event details upon file upload.

## LESSSONS LEARNED

- I learned how to connect S3 bucket events to a Lambda function.
- The importance of selecting the correct **event type** (`ObjectCreated (All)`) for catching uploads.
- How CloudWatch Logs show detailed Lambda execution results.
- How to troubleshoot missing log groups (trigger must first fire before logs appear).
